# Empirical-Asset-Pricing-with-Machine-Learning
This is an exercise I created as a Teaching Assistant for the Course "Advanced Empirical Finance". The goal of this exercise is to recreate parts of the research presented in the paper "Empirical Aset Pricing via Machine Learning", (The Review of Financial Studies, Gu et al., 2020)

Loading and Cleaning Data: 
Uploading data, performing some additional cleaning steps. creating some additional variables as interactions between stock-level characteristics and macro state variables. Aditionally change industry codes to dummies. Additionally I create an illustration of the interaction of some of the macro variables plus a table with some summary satistics of the dataset.
